            undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value that should exist but hasn't been
            assigned yet.
            A variable declared but not initialized explicitly is assigned the value undefined by. <br>

            null is a special value that represents the intentional absence of any value or object.

            <br>
            <span class="text-lg">Use cases of null:</span>
            
            <br>
            To explicitly indicate that a variable or object property has no value.
